# Status report 2

1) We have built the start game and the ingame pages. We now have the ability for a user to click a link containing a gameId and be directed into the game to allow for easy sharing. The game page displays all links from the current Wikipedia page in Alphabetical order.

2) We have had some trouble getting to be fully comfortable with react, but that hurdle has been crossed at this point.

3) Our goals for next week are to make the pages look better, and to build the end game page (currently just says "You won" and displays the path and time). We hope to integrate charts so users can see how they stack up against their friends and competitors.
