# Status report 3

This week was all about improving upon the stong foundation that we already had with most of the major functionality done last week. This week was about adding features. 

1) Email sharing using sendgrid. We implemented the sendgrid Node API such that we are able to prompt users at the end of their game to pick an email and challeng etheir friends to the same game they played against. This allows for easy sharing. This API was awesome because it did all the heavy lifting of email and allowed us to implement this feature relatively easily. 

2) Google Charts. Now, when the game is finished, a chart will be displayed showing the scores of everyone who has played this same game before - hopefully all of those friends you've been sharing the game with via email. This allows you to see how you did time-wise and in the number of moves. 

3) Layouts and sprucing up the interface using JQery. We were able to use a lot of really nice features in JQuery and Bootstrap UI to make some really nifty animations and make the game much more playable. Our focus over the next week will be to continue this work and make the game look as good as possible.
