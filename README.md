# WikiLinks (Team 19, COMP20: Web Programming, Tufts University)

## Project Proposal

### Project Name

WikiLinks

### Project Description

The "Wiki Game," where two or more players attempt to get from one Wikipedia page to another by following the links embedded in the article. This currently requires each player to manually look through each Wikipedia page.

### Orgin Story

This project was originally concieved as Team 19's final project for [COMP20, Web Programming](https://tuftsdev.github.io/WebProgramming/). This original team had 4 members: Joel Reske, Toby Glover, Raina Galbiati, and Ashley Smith - making a demo of the working game as our final project. Afterwards, as the major collaborators on the project, Joel and Toby decided to continue work together. After rebuilding much of the codebase and doing a total redesign, Wilikinks was relaunched on wikilinks.io.
